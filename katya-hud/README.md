Katya is an execution-focused desktop AI agent and the first module of the NeuroPsychoTope system.

This repository documents the system architecture, behavior logic, and design decisions.
The core enforcement and OS-level logic is currently private.

Tech stack:
- React (HUD)
- Python (backend logic & orchestration)
- Socket.IO (real-time communication)
- Chrome Extension (activity telemetry)
- Electron (planned desktop packaging)

A demo video and further documentation will be added.
